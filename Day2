Cyberrange Setup:
During today's class I set up Oracle's VirtualBox and KaliLinux VirtualBox. 
I installed Oracle's VirtualBox from the site www.virtualbox.org. I clicked the option for Windows hosts and began installation.
Oracle's VirtualBox gave me no issues with it's setup, and I was able to finish downloading and setting it up within half an hour.
KaliLinux VirtualBox was a little harder to find, but I got to it eventually.
KaliLinux took me a great deal of time to download, but the setup itself was quite intuitive
